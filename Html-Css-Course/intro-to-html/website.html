        - Order matters for html
        - Each of the lines above represents a separate html element
        - Tags are in the format <tag name> or </tag name>
        - <tag name> is an opening tag and </tag name> is a closing tag
    -->
    <!--link to another website (anchor element):-->
    <a href="https://wwww.youtube.com/" target="_blank">
      Link to YouTube
    </a>
    <!--In the above example href="" is an html attribute that changes how an html element behaves
        - must have a space between tag name and attribute
        - href is the attribute name, www.youtube.com is the attribute value
        - attribute value must always be surrounded by ""
        - can have multiple attributes on a single html element
    -->
    <!--Final Notes:
        - Extra spaces are ignored in html
        - new lines are also ignored
    -->
